## A place for everyone.

Despite our burgeoning tech industry (think Qualcomm, General Atomics), many SoCal students have little to no access to computer science education programs which are often pricey—and students aren't exposed to programming until late high school or college. Hackathons in general can also be scary or intimidating for new programmers. We're hoping to encourage students of all backgrounds, ages, genders, sexualities, and locations to learn and love programming by providing an inclusive environment. No matter who you are, you’re welcome here—and you’ll surprise yourself by what you can accomplish. 💛 For more information on the rules and code of conduct we abide by, check out our <a href="https://hackcodeofconduct.org/1392-hack_the_helyx_hackathon">Hack Code of Conduct.</a>
