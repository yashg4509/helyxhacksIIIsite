## A place for everyone.

Despite our burgeoning tech industry (think Qualcomm, General Atomics), many SoCal students have little to no access to computer science education programs which are often pricey—and students aren't exposed to programming until late high school or college. Hackathons in general can also be scary or intimidating for new programmers. We're hoping to encourage students of all backgrounds, ages, genders, sexualities, and locations to learn and love programming by providing an inclusive environment. No matter who you are, you’re welcome here—and you’ll surprise yourself by what you can accomplish. 💛 For more information on the rules and code of conduct we abide by, check out our <a href="https://hackcodeofconduct.org/1392-hack_the_helyx_hackathon">Hack Code of Conduct.</a>

## FAQ

<FAQ>

- **How much does it cost? 💸**
  Nothing! <a href="http://helyx.science"> The Helyx Initiative </a> believes in accessible education for all and have worked our hardest to make sure that this event can run smoothly without any cost for more people to join in.

- **Who can participate? 🔭**
  Any current student grades 9–12. If you’re under that age, [email us](mailto:info.helyx@gmail.com) & we’ll see what we can do.Gap year and going-to-college in the fall students are also  allowed! And if you're interested in mentoring or helping out, hit us up too!

- **Hacking‽ Is that safe? 👨🏿‍💻**
  No, we’re not “hacking” servers. The word is being constructively redefined for coding—apps, games, websites. It’s safe, supervised, & entirely educational. Now go look somewhere else, RSA.

- **What can I make? 🤖**
  Anything! A website, app, game, hardware hack, you name it. Judges will rate projects on creativity, technical skill demonstrated, polish, utility, theme adherence, and, last but not least, impact.

- **What if I’m new to coding? 👾**
  At Hack the Helyx, complete beginners are not only welcome, but expected! Learn as you go with our tutorials, workshops, and expert help that will be hosted throughout the course of the hackathon.

- **Do I need a team? 👨‍👧‍👧**
  Nope! You’ll have an opportunity to meet fellow hackers and make teams of up to 4 — find some new friends, bring yours, or let us help you find a team.

- **What do I need? 🧳**
  All you need is a computer, WiFi, and access to the Internet to access the online platforms (Discord, GoToMeeting, DevPost, Zoom, etc.) the hackathon will be held.

- **Who runs this? Is it supervised? 👨‍🏫**
  As part of <a href="http://helyx.science">The Helyx Initiative</a>, high schoolers got together and organized this hackathon to spread STEM.
