# Themes

The theme is secret. However, just know that the Helyx motto is "Bioinformatics for All". Hopefully, that gives you a clue about the theme ðŸ˜‰.

## Rules

<ol>
<strong><li> Be nice. </li></strong>
<p>We want to make sure everyone feels welcome and safe to our hackathon and will take action against any violation of this.</p>

<strong><li>Don't feel afraid to ask questions.</li></strong>
<p>We want to make sure that everyone learns and benefits from this hackathon. The best way to do so is taking that step and asking our many active mentors on our <a href="https://discord.gg/XVT94Ha">Discord</a>. We are happy to help!</p>

<strong><li>Please remember that there will be NO monetary prizes for international students outside of the United States.</li></strong>
<p style="padding-right: 30px;">Unfortunately, due to the difference in payments and net of logistics to transfer money/physical prizes to other countries, it has been a legal and financial hassle that we will not be able to overcome. However, we will try to provide software prizes to encourage those internationally who want to compete. Also, remember that it isn't only about prizes!</p>

<strong><li>Remember to submit through Devpost with the appropriate information required.</li></strong>
<p style="padding-right: 30px;">Please remember to submit your work and sign up for the Nucleotide Hackathon on Devpost <a href="https://nucleotide-hackathon.devpost.com/">here</a>. </p>

## Education

A major goal of AngelHacks is to improve educationâ€”especially in computer science. Your project can help achieve this goal! Make a project that encourages students to make a mini-site, help teachers grade homework, create an online notes sharing pod, and more! We want you make a feasible project that can have a real impact on the community and beyond.

# Weâ€™re driven by a mission.

AngelHacks is dedicated in encourage students to learn computer scienceâ€”at just the age where they're interested in technology and programming.

100+ students of all skill levels will assemble for a weekend of collaboration and innovation, each building apps/websites/games that give back to the community in 12 hours. Then participants and judges will select the winning projects and teams.

# Coding is a superpower.

Starting to code has a lasting impact. Once you begin coding, you switch from being a consumer to being a creator. We want to make everyone a creatorâ€”itâ€™s a magical transformation. You can solve problems your way, bounded only by your imagination.

We know this because weâ€™re the leaders of the [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) at Ad Astra School, where we have good infrastructure for students to learn to code. Now, we want to bring that experience to everyone. This is a hackathon by the students, for the students, and for the future of all of Los Angeles.
